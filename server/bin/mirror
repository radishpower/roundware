# This script is run to backup the data for roundware from a given host onto the
# machine from which is is run. This script will install the data into the appropriate
# directories and update the local database to local machine a drop-in replacement for
# the machine it backed up.

# This script is very useful when run as a cron job as frequently as it is necessary
# to back up the data. Running it in a cron job requires that the user running it have
# their ssh client setup with password-less authentication using ssh-keygen.

# TODO: Enable the AUDIO_DIR, username, password, and database to be taken from the
#	existing config file on the local machine. Figure out if want to allow for the
#	src and dst machines to have different config and how to deal with that.
