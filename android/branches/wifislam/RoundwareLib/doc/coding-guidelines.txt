RoundwareLib (RWLib) Coding Guidelines
--------------------------------------

- File must start with open source copyright header.
- Name of (externally visible) classes must start with 'RW'.
- Don't put client app specific stuff in the shared library.
- Keep things in the shared library generic.
- When in doubt keep the code in the app, until proven re-usable.
- Local variables: Start name with 'm' (module), eg. mGeocoder.
- Use RWHtmlLog for logging.
	- RWHtmlLog.e calls must always be done (serious errors).
	- RWHtmlLog.w calls must always be done (warnings).
	- RWHtmlLog.i can be used for debugging, toggled with D boolean.
- Put all user text messages in resources.
- Log messages can go in the code but must be in english.
- Use TAG and D static variables in every class for debugging.
- Stick to formatting used in all files.
- Try to fix warnings early.
- Always fix errors before committing code, obviously.
- Leave to do comments in the code, unless you have resolved them.
- Constant names should be all uppercase with underscores.
- It is acceptable to gradually improve code documentation...
- Carefully consider visibility of methods since it is a library.
- Be aware that things might be shared between simultaneously running apps.
