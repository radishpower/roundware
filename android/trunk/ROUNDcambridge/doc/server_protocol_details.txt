Server Protocol Specifics for ROUND: Cambridge (R2C)
----------------------------------------------------

The Roundware server protocol to be used is mostly the same as what is used
by OceanVoices. This document describes only the differences specific for the
R2C (ROUND: Cambridge) use.

Server

URL: http://r2c.dyndns.org:80

Protocol

Parameters and values:

- config: "r2c"

- categoryid: 10
- subcategoryid: 10

- demographicid: 
	simpler this time with only 4 possibilities. I forget how they are 
	implemented exactly, but this should be the info you need:

	demographicid	ageid	genderid	name
				1	 17	 	1	 		Woman
				2	 17		2	 		Man
				3	 16	 	1			Girl
				4	 16	 	2	 		Boy

- usertypeid: 
	always 17. at this point, I don't want to categorize things by usertype, 
	so we can bypass the usertype selection screens in both SPEAK and LISTEN 
	modes (hopefully this is easy to comment out; let me know as it is possible
	I would want to add it back, but unlikely for r2c)
